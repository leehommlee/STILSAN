# Geographical 
This is pytorch implementation for the spatial pre-trained model in our paper. The spatial pre-trained model is crucial for improving POI recommendation performance.

We will publish our core code when our paper is accepted

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* pytorch == 1.5.0
* python== 3.7.9
